# { Project Title }
## { User requirements }
_Remove any unnecessary questions so you can customize this doc_

- Who is this new feature / request for? 
- What group of users will this affect?
- What capabilities do users need?
- What are the information / assets / knowledge users need?
- What phase of work is necessary? _Wireframe? Wireflow? Prototype? Mid-fidelity, Hi-Fidelity etc._

## What-do-we-know

### What do we already know?
- What is assumed (anecdotally) that we know about the users? 
- What do we already know that is based in research? _(include links or quotes from the research)_

## User Outcomes
Metrics are not a user's goal, an outcome can provide better measure of effectiveness for the user. 
>For example, for a B2B website, an output could be whitepapers and demonstration videos. The outcome could be knowledge gained by customers. Unless you know what information people need and how they will use this information, it is premature to say whether or not a whitepaper or video is the correct solution.
