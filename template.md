# { Project Title }
## { User requirements }
_Remove any unnecessary questions so you can customize this doc_

- Who is this new feature / request for? 
- What group of users will this affect?
- What capabilities do users need?
- What are the information / assets / knowledge users need?
- What phase of work is necessary? _Wireframe? Wireflow? Prototype? Mid-fidelity, Hi-Fidelity etc._

## What-do-we-know

### What do we already know?
- What is assumed (anecdotally) that we know about the users? 
- What do we already know that is based in research? _(include links or quotes from the research)_

## User Outcomes
Metrics are not a user's goal, an outcome can provide better measure of effectiveness for the user. 
>For example, for a B2B website, an output could be whitepapers and demonstration videos. The outcome could be knowledge gained by customers. Unless you know what information people need and how they will use this information, it is premature to say whether or not a whitepaper or video is the correct solution.

### State the problem
- Which user problems or needs are you trying to solve?
- For whom are you solving this problem?
- How does solving this problem help your business?

## Attributes
### Hard Attributes
_Hard-Attributes are objective and measurable, and have to do principally with the functioning and performance of a product; for example, strength, speed, weight, and price. It is however good for us to keep an eye on these limitations, constraints._
- List or explain any technical requirements
- List or explain any feature dependencies
- List or explain any capability requirements
- Include project milestone dates

### Soft Attributes
_These attributes have to do with the character of the product and its userexperience._

- Ideal innovation level
  - [ ] Wireframe
  - [ ] Wireflow
  - [ ] Prototype
  - [ ] Full Fidelity Composition 
- How should the feature make the user feel? 
- How would this feature benefit a user?

## Competitive Analysis
- What are our competitors doing to solve these problems? 
- What opportunities do we have to make the experience better for our users?
